# GeneticArt
Applying genetic programming (evolutionary algorithm) to generate an artistic version of a reference input image  
- Assignment submission for Artificial Intelligence course

## Quick testing:  
Just replace [input.bmp](./"Project%20files"/input.bmp) with another image of the same name (respecting the requirements below) then run `a.out` from the terminal  

## Requirements for the code to compile/run properly  
- Environment: any linux distribution with gcc compiler  
- Dependencies: OpenGL Utility Toolkit [(GLUT)](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) installed (`GL/` has to exist in directory `/usr/include/`)  
- Input image: a valid 512x512 RGB bitmap `*.bmp` file (generated by software such as MS-Paint or Pinta)  

## Compilation under linux 
1. Specify the input image file location `INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` in `main.cpp`
2. Open terminal, navigate `cd` to the directory containing `main.cpp`
3. Run `sh ./compile.sh` to compile the source files into an output executable
4. Execute the generated file using `./a.out`
