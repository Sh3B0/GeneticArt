# GeneticArt
Applying genetic programming (evolutionary algorithm) to generate an artistic version of a reference input image  
- [Assignment](./Task.pdf) submission for Artificial Intelligence course

## Quick testing:  
Just replace 'input.bmp' with another image of the same name (respecting the requirements below) then run `a.out` from the terminal  

## Requirements for the code to compile/run correctly and properly  
- Environment: any linux distribution with gcc compiler  
- Dependencies: OpenGL Utility Toolkit [(GLUT)](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) installed ('GL/' has to exist in directory '/usr/include/')  
- Input image: a valid 512x512 RGB bitmap `*.bmp` file (generated by software such as MS-Paint or Pinta)  
- Performance is machine dependent (a modern machine implies faster generation)

## Compilation under linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
1. Specify the input image file location `INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` in `main.cpp`
2. Open terminal, navigate (cd) to the directory containing `main.cpp`
3. Run `sudo sh ./compile.sh` to compile the source files into an output executable
4. Execute the generated file using `./a.out`
